# course_bioinformatics
This repo [course_bioinformatics](https://github.com/MaxActionWang/course_bioinformatics/) was built on Feb 27, 2021 to manage my code and data mainly generated in the course **bioinformatics** and to be a copy of my assignments in this course.
This **readme** file is the first assignment, in which [Markdown syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet "Markdown refernce") is applied.
